# XIV_Databar - Tome of Teleportation

A companion addon for [XIV_Databar Continued](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/xiv-databar-continued) that replaces the built-in Travel module with a streamlined hearthstone button integrated with [Tome of Teleportation](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomeofteleportation).

## What It Does

- **Left-click** the hearthstone button to use your hearthstone (supports all hearthstone toys, items, and Astral Recall)
- **Right-click** to open the Tome of Teleportation window for quick access to all your teleports, portals, and travel options
- **Hover** to see your hearthstone cooldown and current bind location

## Features

- Seamlessly integrates into XIV_Databar — appears in the same slot as the Travel module
- Supports **all hearthstone variants** including toys (Cosmic Hearthstone, Eternal Traveler's Hearthstone, etc.), items (Ruby Slippers, Innkeeper's Daughter, etc.), and spells (Astral Recall)
- Respects XIV_Databar's **hearthstone selection** and **random hearthstone** settings — no extra configuration needed
- Matches XIV_Databar's theme, colors, and font settings automatically
- Shows real-time hearthstone cooldown in the tooltip
- Combat-safe — will not interfere with secure actions during combat

## Requirements

- [XIV_Databar Continued](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/xiv-databar-continued) (required)
- [Tome of Teleportation](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomeofteleportation) (required for right-click functionality)

## Setup

1. Install XIV_Databar Continued, Tome of Teleportation, and this addon
2. Open XIV_Databar settings (`/xb`)
3. **Disable** the Travel module
4. **Enable** the Tome of Teleportation module
5. That's it — the hearthstone button now appears in the bar with Tome of Teleportation on right-click

## Why Use This?

XIV_Databar's Travel module has its own built-in teleport menu. If you prefer using Tome of Teleportation instead — with its richer filtering, categories, and teleport management — this addon bridges the two together. One click for your hearthstone, one click for everything else.
